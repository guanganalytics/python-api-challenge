# python-api-challenge
Module 6 assignment
This Assignment was given two realistic situations to analyze.

PyWeather Analysis was using the OpenWeatherApp API randomly output hundreds of datapoints.
the features are captured through API like Longitude/Latitude/Cloudness/Humidity Etc.
Once put them all into a DataFrame, scatter charts and linear regression are used to test and show the relatonships between weather factors

PyVacation Anlysis was using the cvs file generated from previous task to get the nearest hotel based of personal preference.
Dataframe information can be used as directionn to pull data from API, on the other hand pulled information can be filled back to dataframe as well
key feature of this analysis is visulize the data points via maps.
